                        identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and
                        you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we
                        become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without
                        verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

                        If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country
                        requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use
                        that information.
